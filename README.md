This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

It's not a production ready code. It's just a quick hack to download samples from splice.com made with Nextjs 13 App Router and tailwindcss.
You can enter your access token and change the search query inside the page.tsx and run it.
PRs are welcome.
